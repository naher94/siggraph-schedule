We describe grid-free Monte Carlo methods for solving partial differential equations on complex geometries. These methods offer unique opportunities to accelerate engineering design cycles by being easy to parallelize and output-sensitive like Monte Carlo rendering, while bypassing the need for simulation-ready meshes that are burdensome to generate for conventional solvers.
