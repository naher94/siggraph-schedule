New graphics technologies, from advanced ray tracing to virtualized geometry, deliver exciting capabilities for application developers, designers, and users. However, they also introduce critical application performance benchmarking challenges for hardware vendors and system buyers who need to accurately compare different configurations. This talk explores how SPEC addressed these challenges in the new SPECviewperf 15 benchmark, including new graphically intensive workloads using modern graphics APIs. Attendees will gain insight into the expanded applicability of the benchmark, along with trade-offs involved in interpreting benchmark results – enabling more informed business decisions – all without needing to purchase applications to do testing.
