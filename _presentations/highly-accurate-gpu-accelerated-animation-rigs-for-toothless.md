Leveraging the GPU in rigging is challenging due to the requirement of proprietary deformers to achieve photorealistic creature work. We present our strategy to accomplish both, high-performance and high-quality deformations, giving animators an interactive experience with high visual fidelity in a streamlined asset pipeline.
