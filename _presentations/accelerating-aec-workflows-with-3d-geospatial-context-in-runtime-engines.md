HNTB, a leading infrastructure engineering firm, collaborates with Cesium to enhance AEC workflows by integrating 3D geospatial context into runtime engines. This partnership reduces modeling time for large-scale projects and introduces tools for efficient editing. Cesium's platform optimizes and streams 3D data, improving design, visualization, and analysis for infrastructure projects.
