Animating bird wing fold poses often requires labor-intensive counter animations. Our innovative surface constraint wing fold system, developed for The Wild Robot, enables animators to maintain folded wings seamlessly during dynamic movements. This system streamlines the process, saving time and allowing animators to focus on compelling performances.
