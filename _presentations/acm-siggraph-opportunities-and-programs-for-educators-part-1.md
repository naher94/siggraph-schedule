The kickoff of the 2025 SIGGRAPH Educators Program will include an overview of activities and opportunities with, and sponsored by, the ACM SIGGRAPH Education Committee. Additionally, the winning entries from the SpaceTime competition will be shown along with a screening of the show reel for the 2025 double-curated Faculty Submitted Student Work (FSSW) exhibit. Designed as a way for educators to share their project ideas across schools and disciplines, FSSW is an online archive of assignment and project briefs as well as a curated video emphasizing the variety of student work and schools submitted. The annual exhibition video is a taste of the content available on the Education Committee website and this event showcases and celebrates to the greater SIGGRAPH community the best examples of student work done for projects and assignments for the 2024-2025 school year.
