We propose a novel mobile scanning solution that allows end-users to reconstruct 3D hairstyles with actual per-strand curves from just a phone scan. Using a mixture of deep learning and optimization, we make hair scanning fast and accessible while delivering qualitative assets ready to be used in any 3D software.
